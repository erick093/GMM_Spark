# Gaussian Mixture Model - Expectation Maximization Method

In the project assignment for the Big Data Processing Class, we implemented the clustering algorithm Gaussian Mixture Models - Expectation Maximization method, where we will analyze and determine the number of clusters in the dataset given the information that the raw numbers on it belong to multiple Gaussian distribution. We need to find the weights, means and standard deviation of this multi-modal dataset.
